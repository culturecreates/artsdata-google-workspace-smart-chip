  schema:description "In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it’s his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi’kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi’kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi’kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”" .

Having been raised to never give up and always try his best by his parents and family, he recently decided it was time to start his own project and put all his time and energy into writing about the life lessons he learned, making many trips back to Nashville over the years to record with his friend Robby Turner on the Turner-Up Recording Label.

Monday Magazine quotes vocalist and guitarist A.W. Cardinal: “Our music defies easy definition. We’ve had people call it indie blues, but I don’t really like being defined by any genre. It tends to make people pre-judge your music,” said Colette. “I’ve had people come up to me after a show and tell me that they’d heard we were a blues group and that they didn’t really like blues, but they really liked us. Those preconceptions can be really misleading.”" .

  schema:description "Recipient of the 2024 Spirit of Folk Award, 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award for Indigenous Songwriter of the Year and the 2023 Capital Music Awards’ Album of the Year, Amanda Rheaume’s rootsy, guitar-driven ballads introduce crucial dimensions to the world of Heartland Rock. In a genre characterized by anthems of underdogs, assumptions and unfair advantages, Rheaume’s sound and story radically expand the boundaries, both geographic and cultural, to make space for new perspectives on resistance and resilience. A Citizen of the Métis Nation, and an active and proud member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, Rheaume’s music is indeed from the heart, and the land." .

  schema:description "OMBIIGIZI – pronounced om-BEE-ga-ZAY, meaning this is noisy – is a collaboration between Zoon (Daniel Monkman) and Status/Non Status (Adam Sturgeon), Anishnaabe artists who explore their cultural histories through sound. Their music together is a rumination on family, a celebration and holistic cleansing, with a strong sense of unity and loving support. An amalgam of their Indigenous heritages and personal musical architectures, Daniel and Adam imbue their lyrics with their families' storytelling, revealing truths and finding common ground amidst their differences. The debut album, entitled Sewn Back Together, is a fusion of individuality – a reflection on Adam and Daniel's commitment to each other as collaborators and distinct members of community. \"Connecting\" is the latest song by OMBIIGIZI, sonic luminaries at the fore of the Anishnaabe revival. An exultant anthem awash in searing guitar melodies and jangling rhythm, “Connecting explores the idea that we’ve not always been given a choice in how to define ourselves. Is it the Indian Act, our identities, our family or the company we keep. It starts with you and we believe.” Erupting in raw emotion and ragged riffage, Connecting is propelled by the growing harmony and volume of Indigenous voices. This is the first of many singles for OMBIIGIZI that are rolling out through 2024. Putting aside the tonal nuances of their previous work as Zoon and Status / Non Status (formerly known as WHOOP-Szo), OMBIIGIZI strips back the waves of distortion to reveal themselves, their voices, writing and improvising for the sake of the song. The family on their debut album “Sewn Back Together” includes Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene on production and The Bathouse Studio's Nyles Spencer engineering. Recorded in fast and intentional sessions during the summer of 2021, Drew and Spencer helped steer this collision of divergent artists into some glorious sonic territory steeped in shoegaze, dream pop, anthemic rock, Chicago post-rock, and 2nd wave emo. While not always getting to play and perform alongside other members of their community, OMBIIGIZI is a coming together – Sewn Back Together is a resounding statement shaped by healing and the guidance of culture. Upon wide critical acclaim, the album received a JUNO Nomination for “Alternative Album of the Year” and a spot on the Polaris Prize Short-List in 2022." .

It’s rare in this era to see an artist build slowly and reach a new level of widespread acclaim two decades into their career.

Growing up in toronto on a combination of soul music, hip-hop, blues, and americana, along with ’90s alternative, julian was still a teenager when he co-founded the alt-rock band staggered crossing in 1996. Within three years, the band signed a publishing deal with industry icon frank davies (“i was the primary songwriter, but wouldn't go without my bandmates, so we all signed the deal, and we all went forward together,” julian recalls) and a record deal with a major label, warner music canada. Staggered crossing’s self-titled debut album was released in 2001 and instantly earned julian his first hit song. “further again,” was one of the most played songs on canadian rock radio in the early 2000s and remains a signature tune of the era in julian’s home country.

The NAC festival will explore nature and water, engaging the senses with performances, talks and visual art installations, while reflecting on our fragile relationship with Earth. Five years after rising to international acclaim with his seminal, award-winning album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa, Jeremy Dutcher returns to the stage with pivotal new music. On the Motewolonuwok tour, Dutcher invites audiences to be transformed by music that is more personal and intimate than ever, yet pushes the boundaries of his unique sonic landscape. This next sonic journey is rooted in an ancestor quote: “Tan qiniw iyuwok wasis kpomawsuwinuwok, 'tankeyutomon-oc kihtahkomikomon.” As long as there is a child among our people, we will protect the land. Combining the skills of NACO with Jeremy Dutcher’s operatic tenor will be a unique experience unlike any other." .

  schema:description "Mohawk rocker turned folk and soul musician Logan Staats began as a diamond in the rough on the streets of Brantford, Ontario. He had no formal musical training, no connections, just a good ear and raw lyrical talent- and always a guitar in hand. He played the local circuit for years before his 2015 debut release ‘Goodbye Goldia’, an unvarnished yet hard hitting solo acoustic album. He went on to win CTV’s ‘The Launch’ in 2018, gaining commercial success and touring across North America and Europe. But traveling the world can really open your eyes to what's going on right at home, and the fight for indigenous sovereignty has become a focal point for Staats in recent years. It all intermingles with the music; the passion, the rage, the love, and most of all the healing. He's making roadtrippin' music for those traveling 'the red road'; a path towards reconnecting and relearning indigenous ways. “I wanted to bring my songwriting back to the medicine inside of music, to the medicine inside of reclamation,” he says. His sound draws heavily from the rich blues and rock legacy of Six Nations. His music has garnered a Juno nomination, multiple Native American Music Awards, and the SOCAN Indigenous Songwriter of the year. Nowadays, he splits his time between his home community Six Nations, and Nashville, where he’s cooking up a southern country-flavored third album." .

  schema:description "A one-night-only opportunity to see these two incomparable artists on the same bill in the PAC’s warm and intimate concert venue in downtown St. Catharines. Widely recognized as one of the most compelling vocalists and songwriters in her genre, Leslie FEIST is a 14-time Juno Award-winning solo artist and founding member of Broken Social Scene. Following the breakout success of her sophomore album Let It Die, she went on to achieve international acclaim with 2007`s The Reminder: a gold-certified release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Pitchfork, NPR, Spin, and Rolling Stone, along with earning four Grammy nominations. The Reminder paved the way for Feist`s appearance on such iconic shows as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Sesame Street\", and setup her Polaris-Prize-winning masterpiece, Metals. Metals was one of three of Feist's albums, including her most recent, Multitudes - to receive \"Album of the Year\" honours from New York Times - the only artist to accomplish such a feat. \"A soul-stirring career highlight\", praised The Guardian, 2023's Multitudes saw her reclaim performance spaces with boundary-breaking performances in the round and put her once again back at the Grammy and Juno Awards in 2024, winning for Best Adult Alternative Album at the latter. Jeremy Dutcher rose to international acclaim with his seminal, award-winning album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa and has since been carving his role as a performer, composer, activist and musicologist. Dutcher performed his new album as part of the PAC’s 23/24 season to an astounded audience. Together, these two prolific artists will leave St. Catharines audiences with hope and healing." .

Kicking off the LUNA Fest experience, LUNA Sound 2024 features 11 bands across four stages taking place on Friday September 20th. The theme of LUNA Fest this year is “In Contrast,” and in contrast to the industry norm, at LUNA Sound this year, we have chosen a predominantly female lineup to honor our commitment to supporting these underrepresented individuals. Despite progress in many areas, these artists often face barriers to belonging and success and encounter challenges such as unequal opportunities, lack of representation, and systemic biases. By showcasing the incredible talent and diversity of women and non-binary musicians, we aim to create a more inclusive and equitable platform. Attendees can expect a vibrant mix of genres including indie pop, electro-soul, violin-driven bass music, R&B, neo-soul, jazz, hip-hop, electro-pop, experimental electronic, pop-rock, garage rock, and synthwave. Each stage will showcase these diverse sounds, creating a dynamic and immersive musical journey." .

  schema:description "The inaugural event was held in Williams Lake in 2023 to encourage awareness and action for truth and reconciliation through sport. This family-oriented, catalyst event brought together residential school survivors, band and community officials, indigenous and non-indigenous spectators, and an array of sporting celebrities under one roof to cheer as one watching a celebrity-style hockey game between ex-NHL/WHL/high-level players and an esteemed Orange Jersey Project team. The expanded 2024 event will include a pancake breakfast, community powwow, bouncy castles, autograph signing (featuring Phyllis (Jack) Webstad – founder of the Orange Shirt Society), an action-packed evening hockey game, and energizing indigenous entertainment (featuring Jordan Hart, Susan Aglukark, and Halluci Nation). Truth and reconciliation can be achieved through dialogue, interaction, and education. Our mission is to create awareness of the intergenerational impacts of Indian Residential Schools." .

  schema:description "After starting a new cycle, 3-time Juno Award Winners- Bear Witness and Tim “2oolman” Hill of A Tribe Called Red reintroduced themselves as The Halluci Nation to reflect the evolution of their music and mission. The Halluci Nation, took its name from a phrase coined by John Trudell, to describe the vast global community of people who remember at their core, what it means to be human. As a visionary artist and activist, Trudell recognized the connection between his accomplishments and what ATCR did intuitively through music and art.Trudell’s voice was the first heard on Tribe’s record, We Are The Halluci Nation, and fittingly, and is also the first you hear on The Halluci Nation’s record, One More Saturday Night. The album is a love letter to the Electric Pow Wow gatherings launched at Ottawa’s Babylon nightclub in 2007. It represents an imagined denouement to the biweekly Saturday-night parties that ended abruptly in 2017, without ever getting the proper send-off. One More Saturday Night thus pays homage to the parties’ energy and momentum that elevated The Halluci Nation to this pivotal point in their career of fully mastering their own music style while also moving beyond club music; or “mixing dance music with dance music,” as Bear Witness succinctly puts it. This is a beginning, not an end, after all. The Halluci Nation maintains focus on what they feel they can impact most: how Indigenous people are seen. Through groundbreaking stage shows and ever-changing visuals, Bear Witness and 2oolman are working to create media that reflects the modern day Indigenous identity. They see themselves simply as contributors to a necessary conversation around a subtle and complex representation of the contemporary Indigenous experience. In November 2023 The Halluci Nation continue to contribute to that conversation with their next project, “The Road To Halluci Mania”, a 2-part EP themed around their love for Professional Wrestling and overcoming obstacles by remaining to be an authentic representation of oneself. “The last album we wrapped up a whole decade of experience up and closed that cycle. In doing so we gave the coordinates of where the future was headed. So that’s what this EP is,” says Bear. “it’s where we are in this present moment and gives another look into plans for the future of The Halluci Nation. It’s a project that people can dance to, but it still has the strong message we are known for. This time we wanted to show it through a bit of a different lens to help further push the conversation about indigenous representation and how we can all impact change”. “Path of The Heel” exposes listeners to the “Heel” side of Professional Wrestling and the plot to take down the “baby face” Tag Team Champions by a group named “The Alie Nation”. This concept is played out through the production of hard hitting Dub-Step and Drum & Bass tracks, combined with further experimentation of cross-genre collaborations featuring Damian Abraham, and drum group Northern Cree. The result catapults The Halluci Nation’s classic sound and their message into the present and beyond. “We wanted to take our music to a place it’s never been before and really challenge our abilities with this project,” says 2oolman. “We showed a little bit of our ambitious side on our last record by making a lot of songs that we’d been wanting to do for a long time. But that was just the beginning. We are at a point where we are making music we love, that is inspired by our everyday lives and all the incredible people that we have been lucky to surround ourselves with. This isn’t even a fraction of it&hellip; We’ve got so much more coming.” This is just the START of THE HALLUCI NATION." .

Willows - Maison vent: Une collection de chansons personnelles qui parle d’abord de femmes : les femmes de sa vie, autant celles qui l’auront précédées que de son expérience personnelle en tant que femme et Métisse de la Rivière Rouge d’origine Franco-Manitobaine et maintenant résidente de Montréal. Les chansons, majoritairement en français avec un peu d’anglais et de Métchif-Français, évoquent le vent, la terre, les lacs, les rivières, les grands espaces et la route. Soleil Launière: Innue originaire de Mashteuiatsh sur les rives du lac Pekuakami, Soleil Launière vit et œuvre à Tiohtià:ke (Montréal). Artiste multidisciplinaire alliant le chant, le mouvement et le théâtre tout en passant par l’art performance, Soleil Launière dévoile à l’automne 2023 Taueu, son premier album soul-roots empreint de tonalités pop et d’arrangements magnétiques. Sur scène, avec les musicien·nes aguerri·es de CHANCES (Chloé Lacasse, Geneviève Toupin, Vincent Carré) et Simon Walls, elle allie les harmonies vocales et les percussions fortes à l’art performance et nous entraîne dans un univers mystérieux et un espace lénifiant. Ce tout nouveau projet intrigant transporte l’auditoire dans une expérience profonde et saisissante." .

Let the exquisite music of the Winnipeg Symphony transport you on a whimsical journey inspired by the enchanting sounds of the forest and the vast boreal landscape we call home. Enjoy Burnstick performers - Music has been at the heart of this dynamic kinship since the duo met over a decade ago. It's no surprise that their songs are timeless and incomparable. Burnstick's signature sound is driven by Jason's proficient playing of 100-year-old Weissenborn lap slide guitars, resonating intently with Nadia's rich and striking vocals. Together, Burnstick pushes the boundaries of contemporary folk music. It's hard to deny the magic they create as they command the stage with their palpable performances and harmony-laced songs. A family unified and guided by music, Burnstick has no plans of stopping anytime soon, as they are set to release their sophomore album this upcoming spring. They will come together with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra to create a performance which celebrates the beautiful, complex, troubled and rich history of Riding Mountain National Park. Before the show, indulge in a delectable plated dinner featuring locally harvested ingredients created by the talented chef from Lakehouse and perfectly complemented with a drink pairings. For more information regarding the culinary experience please stay tuned. Join us for an unforgettable evening of music and nature." .

Critics have tried to label Twin Flames' music, and it's not an easy task; from the start, the duo decided to let their music speak for itself. Their exceptional talent and artistry have earned them forty-four music awards and nominations. This includes the prestigious title of four-time Canadian Folk Music Award winners and 2022 Vocal Group of the Year. Their music is both contemplative Folk and unapologetic Rock ‘n’ Roll, which “The Pitch Kansas City” calls “bigger than two people in front of a crowd.”The husband-wife duo, made up of Chelsey June from Ottawa/Gatineau and Jaaji, Inuk, and Mohawk from Nunavik, performs in English, French, and Inuktitut, which has allowed them to carve out a unique place among contemporary music creators from coast to coast. Their unforgettable humour on stage and impeccable storytelling allow Twin Flames audiences to feel a genuine human connection." .

This welcome extends to locals and visitors alike, including our neighbours from Newfoundland and Labrador in the award-winning group The Once who are playing the Festival for the first time in eight years. With their soothing vocal harmonies and acoustically-rich sound, the modern indie folk trio mingles their musical roots from Newfoundland with folk, bluegrass, country, Americana, and modern indie rock.

  schema:description "Lee Cremo was a Mi’kmaw fiddler from Cape Breton Island who passed away in 1999. Lee was born into a fiddling family. According to the liner notes of his last album, The Champion Returns, Lee's great grandfather, Michael, was given a homemade fiddle by one of the original settlers from Scotland and learned the music of that era. The original fiddle was handed down from father to son until it reached Lee from his father Simon, also a fiddler of great repute. This accounts for the distinct style of Scottish reels and Irish jigs heard in Lee's repertoire. Besides his father, Cremo also soaked up the music of Cape Breton fiddling legends like Winston \"Scotty\" Fitzgerald and Dan Hughie MacEachern at local dances.This performance will feature some of the many performers who were inspired by Lee." .

  schema:description "Snotty Nose Rez Kids tore into the music scene with unmistakeable talent and an unforgettable name. Showing off their lyrical prowess and natural storytelling ability, Yung Trybez and Young D jumpstarted the band with two back-to-back albums in 2017. Their follow up album, 2019’s TRAPLINE, really launched their career with hit “Boujee Natives,” and multiple awards including their first Juno nomination. The band took their high voltage live show on the road and clocked 100 shows in 6 different countries. Their pandemic album, LIFE AFTER, saw greater industry recognition with multiple music magazine cover stories, and strong streaming platform support including Billboard advertisements in Toronto’s Yonge-Dundas Square, playlist cover images, and an Amazon Twitch Channel Takeover. Taking the album on the road, the band toured 80 shows in support of the album across North America. They received their second Juno nomination and performed during the live broadcast. They were invited by The Toronto Raptors to play a half time show, and to the Vancouver Canucks to play in-between periods. Their 2022 project, I’M GOOD, HBU? elevated their career to new heights, and saw them receive their fourth Polaris Prize Shortlist, a win for top music video of the year at the Prism Prize Awards for their Beatles-inspired, DAMN RIGHT, and landed them 3 Western Canadian Music Awards, bringing their tally to 13 wins so far. SNRK have gone on to dominate in Hip-Hop music, most recently achieving their biggest milestone, signing to Sony Music. SNRK are blazing their own path, weaving together a musical fabric of hard-hitting lyricism, revealing stories about the struggles they and their people have encountered, empowering protest songs for the front lines, and a humor that keeps even the heaviest of topics something you can vibe to." .

A multidisciplinary artist, she combines singing, movement and theater with performance art. In autumn 2023, Soleil Launière unveiled her soul-roots debut album Taueu, imbued with pop tones and magnetic arrangements that draw us into a mysterious universe and soothing space, exploring themes of language identity, femininity and matriarchy. On stage, with the seasoned musicians of CHANCES (Chloé Lacasse, Geneviève Toupin, Vincent Carré) and Simon Walls, she combines vocal harmonies and strong percussion with performance art. The NAC is thrilled to see this intriguing new soul-roots project that will transport the audience into a deep and gripping experience at the Fourth Stage." .

  schema:description "A passionate singersongwriter and soulful performer, Leela Gilday has a voice that comes straight from the heart. Confessing her stories to her audiences with a gutsy voice and open stage presence, Gilday weaves her experiences as a northerner, a member of the Dene nation, and a traveler into a beautiful world that transports the listener. If you’re from the North, Leela’s music is home. If you’ve never been, it will take you there. Born and raised in the Northwest Territories, she writes about the people and the land that created her. The power in her voice conveys the depth of her feelings of love and life in a rugged environment and vibrant culture, as if it comes straight from that earth. Leela’s family is from Délįne on the shore of Great Bear Lake and her rich vocals dance across the rhythmic beats of traditional Dene drumming as smoothly as a bass line onstage the largest venues in the country. Leela has toured festivals and concert halls with her four-piece band through every province and territory in Canada. She has played in the United States, Greenland, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in Europe. Her live shows are where she connects with fans who have followed her on a 20-year career and where new fans are born. She reaches into their hearts and feels the energy of every person in front of her as she guides them on a journey through song and experience. She believes music has an inexplicable effect on people. It is a place where she can share light and dark and the most vulnerable moments, with a clarity and genuine purpose that reassures her listeners through every word. She is a storyteller, and through this, reflects the world onto itself. Leela’s fifth album “North Star Calling” was awarded the Indigenous Artist of the Year JUNO Award 2021. It is more raw, more intimate and more Leela than anything you’ve heard from her before. She is currently working on a Dene-language record with her close friend and producer Hill Kourkoutis. It is expected out fallwinter 2024-25." .

  schema:description "Mohawk rocker turned folk and soul musician Logan Staats began as a diamond in the rough on the streets of Brantford, Ontario. He had no formal musical training, no connections, just a good ear and raw lyrical talent- and always a guitar in hand. He played the local circuit for years before his 2015 debut release ‘Goodbye Goldia’, an unvarnished yet hard hitting solo acoustic album. He went on to win CTV’s ‘The Launch’ in 2018, gaining commercial success and touring across North America and Europe. But traveling the world can really open your eyes to what's going on right at home, and the fight for indigenous sovereignty has become a focal point for Staats in recent years. It all intermingles with the music; the passion, the rage, the love, and most of all the healing. He's making roadtrippin' music for those traveling 'the red road'; a path towards reconnecting and relearning indigenous ways. “I wanted to bring my songwriting back to the medicine inside of music, to the medicine inside of reclamation,” he says. This is the philosophy behind his sophomore album ‘A Light In The Attic’, released 2023. These songs are a healing salve, contemplatively composed and offered to listeners in need of comfort. His sound draws heavily from the rich blues and rock legacy of Six Nations. His music has garnered a Juno nomination, multiple Native American Music Awards, and the SOCAN Indigenous Songwriter of the year. Nowadays, he splits his time between his home community Six Nations, and Nashville, where he’s cooking up a southern country-flavored third album." .

  schema:description "Amanda Rheaume’s rootsy, guitar-driven ballads introduce crucial dimensions to the world of Heartland Rock. In a genre characterized by anthems of underdogs, assumptions and unfair advantages, Rheaume’s sound and story crucially and radically expand the boundaries, geographic and cultural, to make space for new perspectives on resistance and resilience. A Citizen of the Métis Nation, and an active and proud member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, Rheaume’s music is indeed from the heart, and the land. First a songwriter, Rheaume comes from a long line of tireless, transformational organizers and activists, and carries this lineage forward in her ever-growing role as a crucial builder of Indigenous music infrastructure and community. From the International Indigenous Music Summit, to newly-founded Ishkode Records, and the National Indigenous Music Office, the goal of raising Indigenous sovereignty in the music industry drives all of Rheaume’s work. Rheaume (she/her) has released 5 full-length albums over a period of 15 years, a self-managed career that has traveled countless tours and milestones. 2013’s Keep a Fire was nominated for a JUNO Award and won a Canadian Folk Music Award for Indigenous Songwriter of the Year. With a new single “100 Years,” a driving, surging Copperhead Road-esque journey through a wilfully, harmfully misrepresented chapter in a violent colonial timeline, Rheaume makes a powerful statement about history and identity." .

She walks in two worlds, with one foot in her Swampy Cree heritage and the other foot in her Euro-Canadian ancestry. Her mission is to create authentic northern Indigenous music, film, and books that are accessible to all children and families. In 2024, Currie will be releasing Sub-Arctic Sing-a-long! This, her third children’s album, introducing listeners to different genres of music, all from a Northern Indigenous perspective. Songs like “My Ribbon Skirt” are up-beat and celebratory while “Do You Know Why?” speaks sensitive truths about why we wear our orange shirts on the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Miranda’s songs are interactive and include Indigenous languages and stories that will delight family audiences." .

  schema:description "A contemporary roots duo featuring sibling songwriters Leela Gilday and Jay Gilday. Sechile Sedare (pronounced ‘seh-chee-leh’ ‘seh-dahr-eh’) means ‘my younger brother, my older sister’ in the Dene language. This musical collaboration sees Jay and Leela co-write and co-create new repertoire together, harnessing their talents as deeply insightful and genuine storytellers. Their voices blend in perfect harmony, hitting notes of nostalgia, hope, humour and reflection. The songs, created during lockdown in 2021 and during a residency at the Banff Centre, share stories about their family history, their connection to the land and water, and the twists and turns of fate." .

  schema:description "An A’nó:wara Dance Theatre solo choreographed and performed by Barbara Kaneratonni Diabo. What We Carry is an expression of Diabo’s life’s journey as she shares many experiences that she carries in the bundle of her body, mind, and spirit. What We Carry is sometimes painful and sometimes joyous as she explores motherhood, Indigenous language and cultural responsibility, relationships, the feminine body, ancestors, and more. She is grateful to be able to walk this path that her ancestors started and the next generations will continue." .

  schema:description "It often takes decades for an artist to really get the feel for the blues as a distinct style of music that sounds better when it’s a little loose, and Alberta’s Blue Moon Marquee has put in the hard miles required to get that feel just right. With four full-length records and thousands of miles of highway in their rearview, Blue Moon Marquee returns to Alberta with multiple accolades from throughout the Canadian blues community to their credit, and their fresh full-length, New Orleans Sessions, a record that has the sound and feel of another era, some kind of chitlin barrelhouse freestyle on the road to a new life in Chicago. Blue Moon Marquee gets it just right, the sauntering, steamy heel drag of the smoky, dimly lit barroom, and the jump and swing of the big bandstand, swaying and shuffling while the moon hangs low over the riverside. Theatrical and energetic, the road-honed sound of Blue Moon Marquee represents a vintage era of the blues—before histrionics took away from the feel—when all it took was a jumpy groove, some sultry charm, and a bourbon-coated voice to shake up the floorboards." .

A classically trained operatic tenor and composer who sings in Wolastoquey, an Indigenous language of Dutcher’s New Brunswick Tobique First Nation, which has fewer than 100 fluent speakers in the world. Recognizing no boundaries between classic western orchestral music and the traditional Indigenous songs of his ancestors, Dutcher doesn’t meet these styles in the middle, but melds them together in a mesmerizing musical concoction that takes the listener on a journey that is very much of the present." .

  schema:description "JEREMY DUTCHER is a classically trained tenor, Two-Spirit song carrier, polymuse, activist, ethnomusicologist, and member of Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation) in Eastern Canada. Dedicated to language revitalization, Jeremy’s debut album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa unearthed century-old archival recordings of his ancestors, turning them into collaborative compositions on the grand piano. Sung entirely in Wolastoqey, his endangered mother tongue, it would go on to win the 2018 Polaris Music Prize and lead to collaborations with such iconic artists as Yo-Yo Ma and Leslie Feist. His sophomore album Motewolonuwok ᒣᑌᐧᐁᓓᓄᐧᐁᒃ was awarded the 2024 Polaris Music Prize, making Jeremy the first ever two-time winner. Jeremy’s music transcends boundaries: unapologetically playful in its incorporation of classical and jazz influences, full of reverence for the traditional songs of his home, and teeming with the urgency of modern-day resistance. He is regularly sought out for his perspectives on queerness, Indigeneity, language revitalization, and fashion." .

  schema:description "Gwynn is a local radio host. Her mother, Maggie, has a story. Maggie has spent a lifetime building a wall between herself and her memories—as well as between herself and her inquisitive, journalist daughter. Now, with a pot of steaming hot tea as the only thing between them, Maggie and Gwynn work to dismantle that wall, uncovering Maggie’s story in a journey of laughter, revelation, understanding, and the bond of a mother and daughter. The Secret to Good Tea is a vibrant, intimate, and cheeky family portrait based on playwright Rosanna Deerchild (CBC Unreserved) and her own mother. Fresh from a world premiere in its home province of Manitoba, Deerchild’s powerful first play is set to make its Ontario debut at the Grand Theatre, in partnership with National Arts Centre Indigenous Theatre. Renae Morriseau, who directed the play’s world premiere, returns to Deerchild’s work once again and will direct The Secret to Good Tea on the Grand Theatre’s Spriet Stage." .

She has since written and recorded 10 albums, founded the Arctic Rose Foundation, authored two children’s books and has a personal memoir in the works. Susan is embarking on her 30th Anniversary of This Child Tour with special guest Angela Amarualik.

  schema:description "Gwynn is a local radio host. Her mother, Maggie, has a story. Maggie has spent a lifetime building a wall between herself and her memories—as well as between herself and her inquisitive, journalist daughter. Now, with a pot of steaming hot tea as the only thing between them, Maggie and Gwynn work to dismantle that wall, uncovering Maggie’s story in a journey of laughter, revelation, understanding, and the bond of a mother and daughter. The Secret to Good Tea is a vibrant, intimate, and cheeky family portrait based on playwright Rosanna Deerchild (CBC Unreserved) and her own mother. Fresh from a world premiere in its home province of Manitoba, Deerchild’s powerful first play is set to make its Ontario debut at the Grand Theatre, in partnership with National Arts Centre Indigenous Theatre. Renae Morriseau, who directed the play’s world premiere, returns to Deerchild’s work once again and will direct The Secret to Good Tea on the Grand Theatre’s Spriet Stage." .

And after pushing back at life — stabbing a steak to her boss’s desk and lighting a magazine rack on fire, for instance — freshly unemployed Beth regroups at her mom’s suburban home.

Elle fait partie du collectif Nikamu Mamuitun et foule les scènes du Québec depuis la sortie d’un premier EP en 2019 où elle y dévoile son univers indie-folk sensible, introspectif et empreint de douceur. Ses chansons marient le français et l’innu-aimun, langue qu’elle apprend à maîtriser dans un processus de réappropriation identitaire. Coup de cœur du public et du jury, elle remporte une douzaine de prix en demi-finales de la 24e édition des Francouvertes. Co-réalisé avec Simon Walls et Jérémie Essiambre, cette année, elle dévoile Mitshuap son premier album tant attendu avec un nouveau spectacle où elle se présente totalement incarnée dans toute sa complexité, une musicalité plus crue, son énergie punk marquée d’une grande poésie qui fait vivre de fortes émotions." .

Following two incredible support tours with Allison Russell and Dan Mangan, as well as countless global festival appearances, it is now time for Aysanabee to take center stage and share his powerful music—including the radio hit singles \"Nomads,\" “We Were Here,” and \"Somebody Else\"—along with his engaging storytelling. The alternative indie artist, originally from the Sucker Clan of Sandy Lake First Nation, a remote fly-in community in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, now calls Toronto home. He began making music under his mother’s maiden name when moments of stillness allowed him to slow down and create music that truly represented him as an artist. He’s been compared to Hozier and Kings of Leon, among others. In March 2024, Aysanabee made history as the first Indigenous artist to win the JUNO Awards for Alternative Album of the Year and the coveted Songwriter of the Year for his EP Here and Now. His debut album, Watin (Nov 2022), named after his grandfather, combined music and journalism with artistry and expression and was shortlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize. He has performed over 300 shows across Canada and globally, including recent appearances at AmericanaFestUK, Tallinn Music Week, The Great Escape, Reeperbahn, SXSW Sydney, and Native Guitars at MeowWolf." .

  schema:description "A gorgeous, powerful musical about an Oji-Cree family whose children were taken away to a residential school in Northern Ontario. The story of Rita, a mother who was never let past the school’s gate, and her kids, Tom and Julia, who never knew she came, pushes toward redemption. Children of God offers a blend of ancient traditions and contemporary realities, celebrating resilience and the power of the Indigenous cultural spirit. Inspired by First Nations music, Corey Payette’s moving score also includes echoes of provocative Broadway masterpieces such as Fun Home and Next to Normal. Children of God takes place in two time periods during the 1950s and 1970s, and is set during a time when it is mandatory by law for all Indigenous children to attend residential schools." .

  schema:description "\"I was often asked where does the title of my album This Child come from? This Child, the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone-ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone-ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and Inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.\" Inuk singer/songwriter Susan Aglukark is one of Canada's most unique artists and a leading voice in Canadian music. She blends the Inuktitut, indigenous and English languages with contemporary pop music arrangements to tell the stories of her fellow people, the Inuit of Arctic Canada and her fellow indigenous groups. The emotional depth and honesty of her lyrics; her pure, clear voice and themes of hope, spirit and encouragement have captivated and inspired listeners from all walks of life. Susan was invited into the Order of Canada and was presented her Officer of the Order of Canada award in September of 2005 for her contribution both musically and as a workshop facilitator and mentor in the indigenous community. Susan was awarded the Governor Generals Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award in June of 2016 and 2022 Juno Humanitarian Award." .

En 2023, elle a dévoilé son premier album Mitshuap – coréalisé avec Simon Walls et Jérémie Essiambre – ainsi qu’un nouveau spectacle où elle se présente totalement incarnée dans toute sa complexité, une musicalité plus crue, son énergie punk marquée d’une grande poésie qui fait vivre de fortes émotions." .

A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages. Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues. For their Arden Theatre performance, Blue Moon Marquee will perform as a trio, backed by Darcy Phillips on Hammond B3 and Rhodes." .

  schema:description "Uvattini (which means “home” in Inuktitut) blends music, narration, video and performance to imagine a space where past and present merge, evoking bittersweet memories and raw emotions. Through her performance, directed by Émilie Monnet, Elisapie guides the audience through her own territory, delivering a musical and sensory experience where rock and pop classics translated into Inuktitut provide a platform for the intimate projection of personal history and subjective and collective pain. Documentary and poetic, Uvattini invites listeners to see and feel what the North and the Inuit who live there are all about. At times, the performance resembles a sacred ritual conveyed through striking musical arrangements, spellbinding lighting effects, and filmed images that transform our perspectives and points of view on the world." .

  schema:description "Children of God is a musical about an Oji-Cree family whose children were taken away to a residential school in Northern Ontario. The story of Rita, a mother who was never let past the school’s gate, and her kids, Tom and Julia, who never knew she came, pushes toward redemption. Children of God offers a blend of ancient traditions and contemporary realities, celebrating resilience and the power of the Indigenous cultural spirit. Inspired by First Nations music, Corey Payette’s moving score also includes echoes of provocative Broadway masterpieces such as Fun Home and Next to Normal. Children of God takes place in two time periods during the 1950s and 1970s, and is set during a time when it is mandatory by law for all Indigenous children to attend residential schools. Performed in English and Anishinaabemowin, this musical is a tremendously impactful piece that explores the history and intergenerational impacts of the residential school system and provides a platform for dialogue about what happened to Indigenous communities in Canada. This play contains some content that may be triggering for some members of the audience. For content warnings, please contact our box office at boxoffice@naccnt.ca or 867-873-4950." .

  schema:description "ASKO is a teaching lodge that you enter into with hesitation and humility. It is an immersive experience in which, if you bring an open heart and an open mind, you will learn to listen in a different register and come out of the lodge with a different perspective than you entered. ASKO is a coming together –a meeting of emotional and intellectual knowledge, a meeting of the heartbeat and the sound of thought travelling through space. It is a place that teaches us how to listen to the energies and forces that continually create nêhiyawak worlds in spite of and despite the noise of colonialism." .

  schema:description "Recipient of the 2024 Spirit of Folk Award, 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award for Indigenous Songwriter of the Year and the 2023 Capital Music Awards’ Album of the Year, Amanda Rheaume’s rootsy, guitar-driven ballads introduce crucial dimensions to the world of Heartland Rock. In a genre characterized by anthems of underdogs, assumptions and unfair advantages, Rheaume’s sound and story radically expand the boundaries, both geographic and cultural, to make space for new perspectives on resistance and resilience. A Citizen of the Métis Nation, and an active and proud member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, Rheaume’s music is indeed from the heart, and the land. First a songwriter, Rheaume comes from a long line of tireless, transformational organizers and activists. She carries this lineage forward in her ever-growing role as a crucial builder of Indigenous music infrastructure and community. From the International Indigenous Music Summitand Ishkode Records, to the National Indigenous Music Office, the goal of raising Indigenous sovereignty in the music industry drives all of Rheaume’s work." .

It is an immersive experience in which, if you bring an open heart and an open mind, you will learn to listen in a different register and come out of the lodge with a different perspective than you entered. ASKO is a coming together –a meeting of emotional and intellectual knowledge, a meeting of the heartbeat and the sound of thought travelling through space. It is a place that teaches us how to listen to the energies and forces that continually create nêhiyawak worlds in spite of and despite the noise of colonialism." .
