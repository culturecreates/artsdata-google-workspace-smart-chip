  schema:description "In just a short amount of time, Toney’s been able to invigorate both the Atlantic music communities and Mi’kmaq communities by bringing together the fiery fiddling of Cape Breton Island with the old songs of the Mi’kmaq, one song dating back up to 500 years. He calls this fusion Mi’kmaltic (Mi’kmaq + Celtic) and it’s his way of celebrating his language and heritage. He’s honoring the elders who’ve taught him the songs and the language, and he’s taking his place on the front lines of Eastern Canada’s cultural divide. On First Flight, reissued March 25, 2022, Toney sings songs so old that modern Mi’kmaq speakers struggle to understand the lyrics, but he also sings songs meant to reflect the turmoil of our current times, shining a hard light on the racism and violence forced on First Nations populations in Canada today. With family members who were sent to residential schools and had to relearn their language later at home, Toney’s interest in the language is very personal. “Some people don’t understand us,” Toney says. “They don’t understand what we’ve been through, and we need to tell the story.” But never one to focus on the negative, Toney’s goal is to push for positive action and change through music. “We wanted to say something in the way that we know how, through music.”Inspired by the unusual example of local fiddler Vincent Joe who had learned the Mi’kmaq Honour Song on the fiddle, Toney figured he could do the same thing with the more difficult Ko’jua song. “There are two worlds of Mi’kmaq music,” Toney explains, “song and fiddle. They had never come together before. People knew of each, but never had I ever seen a collaboration between Celtic and Mi’kmaq culture before. It was either play Mi’kmaq songs with a drum or record a Cape Breton fiddle album. I knew I could sing, but me and Keith really had to think how we could give something out to the world that was different and made sense at the same time. We did that, we blended the two together and it’s been crazy. It’s like an explosion. It’s so fresh, but also familiar, and people can connect with it on a personal level.” Now Toney’s shows are full of both Mi’kmaq and Cape Bretoners reveling in a shared culture, and he’s created a new sound that bridges two worlds, drawing a sense of pure love from both. With all the accolades and attention he’s been receiving recently, it’s easy to forget that Morgan Toney is so new to the music, having only played the fiddle for a few years. But there’s something deeper at work here. When he brought his fiddle back to the same uncle whose Phil Collins DVD first inspired him, Toney’s relative let him know that Toney actually comes from a long line of fiddlers. His great-grandfather and three of his great-uncles were all Mi’kmaq fiddlers of renown in the community. In a sense, Toney’s coming back full circle. And circles are something he understands. “We are living in circles,” he says. “The earth is a circle. The drum is a circle, how we move around is a circle, how we greet each other. The talking circle is huge.”" .

Having been raised to never give up and always try his best by his parents and family, he recently decided it was time to start his own project and put all his time and energy into writing about the life lessons he learned, making many trips back to Nashville over the years to record with his friend Robby Turner on the Turner-Up Recording Label.

Monday Magazine quotes vocalist and guitarist A.W. Cardinal: “Our music defies easy definition. We’ve had people call it indie blues, but I don’t really like being defined by any genre. It tends to make people pre-judge your music,” said Colette. “I’ve had people come up to me after a show and tell me that they’d heard we were a blues group and that they didn’t really like blues, but they really liked us. Those preconceptions can be really misleading.”" .

  schema:description "Recipient of the 2024 Spirit of Folk Award, 2023 Canadian Folk Music Award for Indigenous Songwriter of the Year and the 2023 Capital Music Awards’ Album of the Year, Amanda Rheaume’s rootsy, guitar-driven ballads introduce crucial dimensions to the world of Heartland Rock. In a genre characterized by anthems of underdogs, assumptions and unfair advantages, Rheaume’s sound and story radically expand the boundaries, both geographic and cultural, to make space for new perspectives on resistance and resilience. A Citizen of the Métis Nation, and an active and proud member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, Rheaume’s music is indeed from the heart, and the land." .

  schema:description "OMBIIGIZI – pronounced om-BEE-ga-ZAY, meaning this is noisy – is a collaboration between Zoon (Daniel Monkman) and Status/Non Status (Adam Sturgeon), Anishnaabe artists who explore their cultural histories through sound. Their music together is a rumination on family, a celebration and holistic cleansing, with a strong sense of unity and loving support. An amalgam of their Indigenous heritages and personal musical architectures, Daniel and Adam imbue their lyrics with their families' storytelling, revealing truths and finding common ground amidst their differences. The debut album, entitled Sewn Back Together, is a fusion of individuality – a reflection on Adam and Daniel's commitment to each other as collaborators and distinct members of community. \"Connecting\" is the latest song by OMBIIGIZI, sonic luminaries at the fore of the Anishnaabe revival. An exultant anthem awash in searing guitar melodies and jangling rhythm, “Connecting explores the idea that we’ve not always been given a choice in how to define ourselves. Is it the Indian Act, our identities, our family or the company we keep. It starts with you and we believe.” Erupting in raw emotion and ragged riffage, Connecting is propelled by the growing harmony and volume of Indigenous voices. This is the first of many singles for OMBIIGIZI that are rolling out through 2024. Putting aside the tonal nuances of their previous work as Zoon and Status / Non Status (formerly known as WHOOP-Szo), OMBIIGIZI strips back the waves of distortion to reveal themselves, their voices, writing and improvising for the sake of the song. The family on their debut album “Sewn Back Together” includes Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene on production and The Bathouse Studio's Nyles Spencer engineering. Recorded in fast and intentional sessions during the summer of 2021, Drew and Spencer helped steer this collision of divergent artists into some glorious sonic territory steeped in shoegaze, dream pop, anthemic rock, Chicago post-rock, and 2nd wave emo. While not always getting to play and perform alongside other members of their community, OMBIIGIZI is a coming together – Sewn Back Together is a resounding statement shaped by healing and the guidance of culture. Upon wide critical acclaim, the album received a JUNO Nomination for “Alternative Album of the Year” and a spot on the Polaris Prize Short-List in 2022." .

It’s rare in this era to see an artist build slowly and reach a new level of widespread acclaim two decades into their career.

Growing up in toronto on a combination of soul music, hip-hop, blues, and americana, along with ’90s alternative, julian was still a teenager when he co-founded the alt-rock band staggered crossing in 1996. Within three years, the band signed a publishing deal with industry icon frank davies (“i was the primary songwriter, but wouldn't go without my bandmates, so we all signed the deal, and we all went forward together,” julian recalls) and a record deal with a major label, warner music canada. Staggered crossing’s self-titled debut album was released in 2001 and instantly earned julian his first hit song. “further again,” was one of the most played songs on canadian rock radio in the early 2000s and remains a signature tune of the era in julian’s home country.

The NAC festival will explore nature and water, engaging the senses with performances, talks and visual art installations, while reflecting on our fragile relationship with Earth. Five years after rising to international acclaim with his seminal, award-winning album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa, Jeremy Dutcher returns to the stage with pivotal new music. On the Motewolonuwok tour, Dutcher invites audiences to be transformed by music that is more personal and intimate than ever, yet pushes the boundaries of his unique sonic landscape. This next sonic journey is rooted in an ancestor quote: “Tan qiniw iyuwok wasis kpomawsuwinuwok, 'tankeyutomon-oc kihtahkomikomon.” As long as there is a child among our people, we will protect the land. Combining the skills of NACO with Jeremy Dutcher’s operatic tenor will be a unique experience unlike any other." .

  schema:description "Mohawk rocker turned folk and soul musician Logan Staats began as a diamond in the rough on the streets of Brantford, Ontario. He had no formal musical training, no connections, just a good ear and raw lyrical talent- and always a guitar in hand. He played the local circuit for years before his 2015 debut release ‘Goodbye Goldia’, an unvarnished yet hard hitting solo acoustic album. He went on to win CTV’s ‘The Launch’ in 2018, gaining commercial success and touring across North America and Europe. But traveling the world can really open your eyes to what's going on right at home, and the fight for indigenous sovereignty has become a focal point for Staats in recent years. It all intermingles with the music; the passion, the rage, the love, and most of all the healing. He's making roadtrippin' music for those traveling 'the red road'; a path towards reconnecting and relearning indigenous ways. “I wanted to bring my songwriting back to the medicine inside of music, to the medicine inside of reclamation,” he says. His sound draws heavily from the rich blues and rock legacy of Six Nations. His music has garnered a Juno nomination, multiple Native American Music Awards, and the SOCAN Indigenous Songwriter of the year. Nowadays, he splits his time between his home community Six Nations, and Nashville, where he’s cooking up a southern country-flavored third album." .

  schema:description "A one-night-only opportunity to see these two incomparable artists on the same bill in the PAC’s warm and intimate concert venue in downtown St. Catharines. Widely recognized as one of the most compelling vocalists and songwriters in her genre, Leslie FEIST is a 14-time Juno Award-winning solo artist and founding member of Broken Social Scene. Following the breakout success of her sophomore album Let It Die, she went on to achieve international acclaim with 2007`s The Reminder: a gold-certified release that landed on best-of-the-year lists from outlets like Pitchfork, NPR, Spin, and Rolling Stone, along with earning four Grammy nominations. The Reminder paved the way for Feist`s appearance on such iconic shows as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Sesame Street\", and setup her Polaris-Prize-winning masterpiece, Metals. Metals was one of three of Feist's albums, including her most recent, Multitudes - to receive \"Album of the Year\" honours from New York Times - the only artist to accomplish such a feat. \"A soul-stirring career highlight\", praised The Guardian, 2023's Multitudes saw her reclaim performance spaces with boundary-breaking performances in the round and put her once again back at the Grammy and Juno Awards in 2024, winning for Best Adult Alternative Album at the latter. Jeremy Dutcher rose to international acclaim with his seminal, award-winning album Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa and has since been carving his role as a performer, composer, activist and musicologist. Dutcher performed his new album as part of the PAC’s 23/24 season to an astounded audience. Together, these two prolific artists will leave St. Catharines audiences with hope and healing." .

Kicking off the LUNA Fest experience, LUNA Sound 2024 features 11 bands across four stages taking place on Friday September 20th. The theme of LUNA Fest this year is “In Contrast,” and in contrast to the industry norm, at LUNA Sound this year, we have chosen a predominantly female lineup to honor our commitment to supporting these underrepresented individuals. Despite progress in many areas, these artists often face barriers to belonging and success and encounter challenges such as unequal opportunities, lack of representation, and systemic biases. By showcasing the incredible talent and diversity of women and non-binary musicians, we aim to create a more inclusive and equitable platform. Attendees can expect a vibrant mix of genres including indie pop, electro-soul, violin-driven bass music, R&B, neo-soul, jazz, hip-hop, electro-pop, experimental electronic, pop-rock, garage rock, and synthwave. Each stage will showcase these diverse sounds, creating a dynamic and immersive musical journey." .

  schema:description "The inaugural event was held in Williams Lake in 2023 to encourage awareness and action for truth and reconciliation through sport. This family-oriented, catalyst event brought together residential school survivors, band and community officials, indigenous and non-indigenous spectators, and an array of sporting celebrities under one roof to cheer as one watching a celebrity-style hockey game between ex-NHL/WHL/high-level players and an esteemed Orange Jersey Project team. The expanded 2024 event will include a pancake breakfast, community powwow, bouncy castles, autograph signing (featuring Phyllis (Jack) Webstad – founder of the Orange Shirt Society), an action-packed evening hockey game, and energizing indigenous entertainment (featuring Jordan Hart, Susan Aglukark, and Halluci Nation). Truth and reconciliation can be achieved through dialogue, interaction, and education. Our mission is to create awareness of the intergenerational impacts of Indian Residential Schools." .

  schema:description "After starting a new cycle, 3-time Juno Award Winners- Bear Witness and Tim “2oolman” Hill of A Tribe Called Red reintroduced themselves as The Halluci Nation to reflect the evolution of their music and mission. The Halluci Nation, took its name from a phrase coined by John Trudell, to describe the vast global community of people who remember at their core, what it means to be human. As a visionary artist and activist, Trudell recognized the connection between his accomplishments and what ATCR did intuitively through music and art.Trudell’s voice was the first heard on Tribe’s record, We Are The Halluci Nation, and fittingly, and is also the first you hear on The Halluci Nation’s record, One More Saturday Night. The album is a love letter to the Electric Pow Wow gatherings launched at Ottawa’s Babylon nightclub in 2007. It represents an imagined denouement to the biweekly Saturday-night parties that ended abruptly in 2017, without ever getting the proper send-off. One More Saturday Night thus pays homage to the parties’ energy and momentum that elevated The Halluci Nation to this pivotal point in their career of fully mastering their own music style while also moving beyond club music; or “mixing dance music with dance music,” as Bear Witness succinctly puts it. This is a beginning, not an end, after all. The Halluci Nation maintains focus on what they feel they can impact most: how Indigenous people are seen. Through groundbreaking stage shows and ever-changing visuals, Bear Witness and 2oolman are working to create media that reflects the modern day Indigenous identity. They see themselves simply as contributors to a necessary conversation around a subtle and complex representation of the contemporary Indigenous experience. In November 2023 The Halluci Nation continue to contribute to that conversation with their next project, “The Road To Halluci Mania”, a 2-part EP themed around their love for Professional Wrestling and overcoming obstacles by remaining to be an authentic representation of oneself. “The last album we wrapped up a whole decade of experience up and closed that cycle. In doing so we gave the coordinates of where the future was headed. So that’s what this EP is,” says Bear. “it’s where we are in this present moment and gives another look into plans for the future of The Halluci Nation. It’s a project that people can dance to, but it still has the strong message we are known for. This time we wanted to show it through a bit of a different lens to help further push the conversation about indigenous representation and how we can all impact change”. “Path of The Heel” exposes listeners to the “Heel” side of Professional Wrestling and the plot to take down the “baby face” Tag Team Champions by a group named “The Alie Nation”. This concept is played out through the production of hard hitting Dub-Step and Drum & Bass tracks, combined with further experimentation of cross-genre collaborations featuring Damian Abraham, and drum group Northern Cree. The result catapults The Halluci Nation’s classic sound and their message into the present and beyond. “We wanted to take our music to a place it’s never been before and really challenge our abilities with this project,” says 2oolman. “We showed a little bit of our ambitious side on our last record by making a lot of songs that we’d been wanting to do for a long time. But that was just the beginning. We are at a point where we are making music we love, that is inspired by our everyday lives and all the incredible people that we have been lucky to surround ourselves with. This isn’t even a fraction of it&hellip; We’ve got so much more coming.” This is just the START of THE HALLUCI NATION." .

Willows - Maison vent: Une collection de chansons personnelles qui parle d’abord de femmes : les femmes de sa vie, autant celles qui l’auront précédées que de son expérience personnelle en tant que femme et Métisse de la Rivière Rouge d’origine Franco-Manitobaine et maintenant résidente de Montréal. Les chansons, majoritairement en français avec un peu d’anglais et de Métchif-Français, évoquent le vent, la terre, les lacs, les rivières, les grands espaces et la route. Soleil Launière: Innue originaire de Mashteuiatsh sur les rives du lac Pekuakami, Soleil Launière vit et œuvre à Tiohtià:ke (Montréal). Artiste multidisciplinaire alliant le chant, le mouvement et le théâtre tout en passant par l’art performance, Soleil Launière dévoile à l’automne 2023 Taueu, son premier album soul-roots empreint de tonalités pop et d’arrangements magnétiques. Sur scène, avec les musicien·nes aguerri·es de CHANCES (Chloé Lacasse, Geneviève Toupin, Vincent Carré) et Simon Walls, elle allie les harmonies vocales et les percussions fortes à l’art performance et nous entraîne dans un univers mystérieux et un espace lénifiant. Ce tout nouveau projet intrigant transporte l’auditoire dans une expérience profonde et saisissante." .

Let the exquisite music of the Winnipeg Symphony transport you on a whimsical journey inspired by the enchanting sounds of the forest and the vast boreal landscape we call home. Enjoy Burnstick performers - Music has been at the heart of this dynamic kinship since the duo met over a decade ago. It's no surprise that their songs are timeless and incomparable. Burnstick's signature sound is driven by Jason's proficient playing of 100-year-old Weissenborn lap slide guitars, resonating intently with Nadia's rich and striking vocals. Together, Burnstick pushes the boundaries of contemporary folk music. It's hard to deny the magic they create as they command the stage with their palpable performances and harmony-laced songs. A family unified and guided by music, Burnstick has no plans of stopping anytime soon, as they are set to release their sophomore album this upcoming spring. They will come together with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra to create a performance which celebrates the beautiful, complex, troubled and rich history of Riding Mountain National Park. Before the show, indulge in a delectable plated dinner featuring locally harvested ingredients created by the talented chef from Lakehouse and perfectly complemented with a drink pairings. For more information regarding the culinary experience please stay tuned. Join us for an unforgettable evening of music and nature." .

Their exceptional talent and artistry have earned them forty-four music awards and nominations. This includes the prestigious title of four-time Canadian Folk Music Award winners and 2022 Vocal Group of the Year. Their music is both contemplative Folk and unapologetic Rock ‘n’ Roll, which “The Pitch Kansas City” calls “bigger than two people in front of a crowd.”The husband-wife duo, made up of Chelsey June from Ottawa/Gatineau and Jaaji, Inuk, and Mohawk from Nunavik, performs in English, French, and Inuktitut, which has allowed them to carve out a unique place among contemporary music creators from coast to coast. Their unforgettable humour on stage and impeccable storytelling allow Twin Flames audiences to feel a genuine human connection." .

This welcome extends to locals and visitors alike, including our neighbours from Newfoundland and Labrador in the award-winning group The Once who are playing the Festival for the first time in eight years.

  schema:description "Lee Cremo was a Mi’kmaw fiddler from Cape Breton Island who passed away in 1999. Lee was born into a fiddling family. According to the liner notes of his last album, The Champion Returns, Lee's great grandfather, Michael, was given a homemade fiddle by one of the original settlers from Scotland and learned the music of that era. The original fiddle was handed down from father to son until it reached Lee from his father Simon, also a fiddler of great repute. This accounts for the distinct style of Scottish reels and Irish jigs heard in Lee's repertoire. Besides his father, Cremo also soaked up the music of Cape Breton fiddling legends like Winston \"Scotty\" Fitzgerald and Dan Hughie MacEachern at local dances.This performance will feature some of the many performers who were inspired by Lee." .

  schema:description "Snotty Nose Rez Kids tore into the music scene with unmistakeable talent and an unforgettable name. Showing off their lyrical prowess and natural storytelling ability, Yung Trybez and Young D jumpstarted the band with two back-to-back albums in 2017. Their follow up album, 2019’s TRAPLINE, really launched their career with hit “Boujee Natives,” and multiple awards including their first Juno nomination. The band took their high voltage live show on the road and clocked 100 shows in 6 different countries. Their pandemic album, LIFE AFTER, saw greater industry recognition with multiple music magazine cover stories, and strong streaming platform support including Billboard advertisements in Toronto’s Yonge-Dundas Square, playlist cover images, and an Amazon Twitch Channel Takeover. Taking the album on the road, the band toured 80 shows in support of the album across North America. They received their second Juno nomination and performed during the live broadcast. They were invited by The Toronto Raptors to play a half time show, and to the Vancouver Canucks to play in-between periods. Their 2022 project, I’M GOOD, HBU? elevated their career to new heights, and saw them receive their fourth Polaris Prize Shortlist, a win for top music video of the year at the Prism Prize Awards for their Beatles-inspired, DAMN RIGHT, and landed them 3 Western Canadian Music Awards, bringing their tally to 13 wins so far. SNRK have gone on to dominate in Hip-Hop music, most recently achieving their biggest milestone, signing to Sony Music. SNRK are blazing their own path, weaving together a musical fabric of hard-hitting lyricism, revealing stories about the struggles they and their people have encountered, empowering protest songs for the front lines, and a humor that keeps even the heaviest of topics something you can vibe to." .

A multidisciplinary artist, she combines singing, movement and theater with performance art. In autumn 2023, Soleil Launière unveiled her soul-roots debut album Taueu, imbued with pop tones and magnetic arrangements that draw us into a mysterious universe and soothing space, exploring themes of language identity, femininity and matriarchy. On stage, with the seasoned musicians of CHANCES (Chloé Lacasse, Geneviève Toupin, Vincent Carré) and Simon Walls, she combines vocal harmonies and strong percussion with performance art. The NAC is thrilled to see this intriguing new soul-roots project that will transport the audience into a deep and gripping experience at the Fourth Stage." .

  schema:description "Amanda Rheaume’s rootsy, guitar-driven ballads introduce crucial dimensions to the world of Heartland Rock. In a genre characterized by anthems of underdogs, assumptions and unfair advantages, Rheaume’s sound and story crucially and radically expand the boundaries, geographic and cultural, to make space for new perspectives on resistance and resilience. A Citizen of the Métis Nation, and an active and proud member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community, Rheaume’s music is indeed from the heart, and the land. First a songwriter, Rheaume comes from a long line of tireless, transformational organizers and activists, and carries this lineage forward in her ever-growing role as a crucial builder of Indigenous music infrastructure and community. From the International Indigenous Music Summit, to newly-founded Ishkode Records, and the National Indigenous Music Office, the goal of raising Indigenous sovereignty in the music industry drives all of Rheaume’s work. Rheaume (she/her) has released 5 full-length albums over a period of 15 years, a self-managed career that has traveled countless tours and milestones. 2013’s Keep a Fire was nominated for a JUNO Award and won a Canadian Folk Music Award for Indigenous Songwriter of the Year. With a new single “100 Years,” a driving, surging Copperhead Road-esque journey through a wilfully, harmfully misrepresented chapter in a violent colonial timeline, Rheaume makes a powerful statement about history and identity." .

Susan holds several Honourary Doctorate degrees and has held command performances. Her journey as a singer-songwriter began in the early 1990’s when she began her writing and recording career. In Susan’s early reflections was the discovery of the platform as learning, sharing and healing, this inspired her major label debut album This Child, released in January 1995. She has since written and recorded 10 albums, founded the Arctic Rose Foundation, authored two children’s books and has a personal memoir in the works. Susan is embarking on her 30th Anniversary of This Child Tour with special guest Angela Amarualik. Her writing of This Child brought her to a personal call to action, get on the platform and speak up, learn, heal, share. This has been her work for these 30 years." .

Fresh from a world premiere in its home province of Manitoba, Deerchild’s powerful first play is set to make its Ontario debut at the Grand Theatre, in partnership with National Arts Centre Indigenous Theatre. Renae Morriseau, who directed the play’s world premiere, returns to Deerchild’s work once again and will direct The Secret to Good Tea on the Grand Theatre’s Spriet Stage." .

  schema:description "Little Red Warrior, the last remaining member of the Little Red Warrior First Nation, discovers construction has begun on his ancestral lands. In a fit of rage, he attacks an engineer, gets arrested, thrown in jail, and assigned a court-appointed lawyer, Larry. Much to the dismay of his wife, Larry invites a displaced Little Red Warrior to stay with them. But when you invite a coyote into your coop, he might just walk away with your chickens." .

  schema:description "Susan Aglukark, Canada's first Inuk Juno winner with 4 awards, holds a Governor General's Performing Arts Award and is an Officer of the Order of Canada. Beginning in the early 1990s, she embarked on a career as a singer-songwriter, releasing her major label debut album \"This Child\" in 1995. Throughout her journey, Susan has released 10 albums, founded the Arctic Rose Foundation, authored children's books, and continues her advocacy through music and storytelling. For Susan, art has played a significant role in her healing journey and in the re-writing of her narrative, she believes it plays an important role for indigenous youth who are dealing with contemporary identity issues today. 'Our children and youth are strong and resilient, they still believe very strongly in their culture, in Inuit or Indigenous culture, and they are still fighting every day to find their place.'Celebrating her 30th anniversary tour of \"This Child,\" Susan's work emphasizes learning, healing, and sharing through her platform." .

  schema:description "\"I was often asked where does the title of my album This Child come from? This Child, the song was my artist statement, my call to personal action. At the time that I began song writing, I wrote from what I knew and I knew only my experiences from living and knowing life in the arctic, how does one turn a life lived in a small arctic town into a major label debut album? I started with what I knew and at the time that I was writing This Child, what I knew was a life of deep alone-ness. I left home to start over and this felt very much like a disconnecting from something critical, a land based way of connection which was the Inuit way and a most beautiful kind of connecting to humanity, the alone-ness came from the fear that I was disconnecting from this. The introduction to singing, writing and recording gave that alone-ness a place, a voice, a direction. This Child was my song to my future artist and Inuk self, telling myself to write who you are so you don't ever forget where you come from, who you are and why you left.\" Inuk singer/songwriter Susan Aglukark is one of Canada's most unique artists and a leading voice in Canadian music. She blends the Inuktitut, indigenous and English languages with contemporary pop music arrangements to tell the stories of her fellow people, the Inuit of Arctic Canada and her fellow indigenous groups. The emotional depth and honesty of her lyrics; her pure, clear voice and themes of hope, spirit and encouragement have captivated and inspired listeners from all walks of life. Susan was invited into the Order of Canada and was presented her Officer of the Order of Canada award in September of 2005 for her contribution both musically and as a workshop facilitator and mentor in the indigenous community. Susan was awarded the Governor Generals Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award in June of 2016 and 2022 Juno Humanitarian Award." .

A.W. Cardinal (vocals/guitar) and Jasmine Colette a.k.a. Badlands Jass (vocals/bass/drums) have played for a vast gamut of crowds at jazz clubs, Lindy Hop dance halls, folk venues, blues haunts, hospitals, prisons, markets, motorcycle joints, dive bars and prestigious festival stages. Colette not only commands the upright bass but also brings the rhythm with her feet on a custom foot drum kit, all while singing in her signature honey-dipped tone. Cardinal’s distinctive and soulful vocals barrel out like a raging bull while his guitar crackles with the swinging energy of jazz-tinged blues. For their Arden Theatre performance, Blue Moon Marquee will perform as a trio, backed by Darcy Phillips on Hammond B3 and Rhodes." .

Through her performance, directed by Émilie Monnet, Elisapie guides the audience through her own territory, delivering a musical and sensory experience where rock and pop classics translated into Inuktitut provide a platform for the intimate projection of personal history and subjective and collective pain. Documentary and poetic, Uvattini invites listeners to see and feel what the North and the Inuit who live there are all about. At times, the performance resembles a sacred ritual conveyed through striking musical arrangements, spellbinding lighting effects, and filmed images that transform our perspectives and points of view on the world." .

  schema:description "Three basic cousins attend the 222nd Annual Powwow, but everything has changed. The powwow committee has sold out to a controlling corporation known as \"The Watcher\"; undoing all policy and rewriting all rules. For the first time in history, the powwow has become a competition bringing forth the cousins' nemesis and keeping the cousins and the emcee gripping with their own internal conflict and a fight to save the powwow. Playwright April Rogers is an alumni of GTNT’s Circle of Voices program and Powwow is their first produced work as a playwright. Powwow was commissioned by GTNT through the New Voices program - a GTNT initiative to cultivate the next generation of storytellers. New Voices is a paid, six month residency program focused on developing new Indigenous writers." .
